## Overview

A brief description of your project, its purpose, and what it does.

## Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before installing, ensure you have the following tools installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher)  
  You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn** for managing packages

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:

   Using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or, using yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Project

Once the dependencies are installed, run the project using the following command:

- Using npm:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

- Using yarn:
  ```bash
  yarn start
  ```

This will start the development server, and the app should be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Building for Production

To create a production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

or

```bash
yarn build
```

This will generate an optimized build in the `/build` directory, ready for deployment.

### Testing

```bash
npm test
```

or

```bash
yarn test
```

### Key Libraries Used
